# Glaucoma Grading with Single and Multi-Modality Deep Learning  
*Fundus Photography (CFP) + Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)*  

This repository contains the official implementation of our URECA@NTU 2024‚Äì25 research project:  

**Single and Multi-Modality Fusion Deep Learning Approaches for Glaucoma Grading Using Fundus and OCT Imaging**

## üîç Overview  
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Automated grading of its severity from retinal imaging is critical for clinical decision-making.  

In this work, we investigate:  
- **Single-modality approaches** using **RETFound**, a transformer-based foundation model, fine-tuned on:  
  - **Fundus (CFP)** images (REFUGE2 + GAMMA datasets)  
  - **OCT slices** (GAMMA dataset)  
- **Multi-modality approaches** combining **CFP + OCT** using:  
  - **Dual-branch ResNet34** (CNN-based fusion)  
  - **Dual-branch RETFound ViT** (Transformer-based fusion)  

Our experiments show that while RETFound excels in single-modality settings, the **dual-branch CNN fusion model** achieves the most reliable multi-class glaucoma grading.
